# Space Mission Control üöÄ

A space-themed task management app specifically designed for people with ADHD. Transform your daily tasks into exciting space missions with an engaging, distraction-minimizing interface.

## Black Hole Visualization üåå

Our app features a stunning, physically accurate black hole visualization based on real astrophysics:

### Physical Accuracy
- **Event Horizon**: A true black void where light cannot escape
- **Accretion Disk**: Super-heated matter orbiting the black hole
- **Gravitational Lensing**: Light bending effects near the event horizon
- **Relativistic Effects**: Including blue/redshift of orbiting matter

### Technical Implementation
- **Three.js & React Three Fiber**: For 3D rendering
- **Custom GLSL Shaders**: For realistic accretion disk effects
- **Particle Systems**: Simulating matter falling into the black hole
- **Dynamic Animations**: 
  - Rotating accretion disk
  - Pulsating event horizon
  - Particle dynamics

### Visual Elements
- **Event Horizon**: Pure black sphere with perfect light absorption
- **Accretion Disk**: 
  - Intense orange-red plasma effect
  - Dynamic turbulence patterns
  - Blue/redshift simulation
- **Particle System**: Dynamic matter flow visualization
